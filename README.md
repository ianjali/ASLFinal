Introduction

Sign language is an important means of communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, and developing accurate and reliable sign language recognition systems can have a significant impact on their daily lives.

trainEncoderDecoder.py :

For preprocessing and running the encoder decoder Module. This file will call the function from EncoderDecoder.py file on its own which is returning the trained model.


somProcessing.py

This file will run SOMImplementation (somImplement.py) after getting the encoded representation of images from encoder module which is saved previosuly from the above file after training.

SOFM_3D.py
This file is future scope of the project, and I am still working on this. 

using EncodedInformationForModelling.py
In this file I was trying to get the accuracy from SVM and KMeans are not working properly, I have not added the results from this in report.
